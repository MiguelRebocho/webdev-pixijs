# webdev-pixijs

Project will start by presenting a PIXIJS menu with 3 buttons, each one for a different section of what was requested.

# Improvements

- Load images on game load and not during game runtime
- Make webpackage smaller
- Make scene container responsive to screen size
- Change menu from PIXIJS to HTML (Navigation logic easier to manage if handled by REACT)
